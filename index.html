      <p class="lead">Another WAR between two hostile countries had begun, But how? Who won the War? What was the reason
        behind this genocide?
        Why India attacked Pakistan in the dark hours of night? What happened with Indian forces?
        <br>Pakistan fought valiantly,heroically and bravely against India and won in many feilds, there is no
        hesitation to say that Pak Army succeded. Although, India
        failed annexing Lahore but she still declares it as a winner.

          <h2>Major Causes :-</h2>
          <b>1.</b>Although Kashmir problem was creating more hatred among both countries, other border disputes
          including Ran of Kutch
          was also a source of violence. In January,1965 India regained her control on this territory, Pak forces
          started patrolling the area
          and a border war started between them. Later British PM Harlod Winson requested to end this small-scale war,
          thus resulting in cease fired !
          Later(1968), Pakistan was awarded 910 km<sup>2</sup> area of Rann of Kutch. <br>
          <b>2.</b>In 1963, hair of Prophet(SAWW) was stolen from Srinagar(Jammu), people blamed Indian government for
          this shameful act. <br>
          <b>3.</b>Bhutto believed that Kashmir could be only gained by force, he and Gen. Akhtar was forcing Ayub Khan
          to take action against India.

        <div style="width:138%" class="gibralter">
          <h2>Operation Gibralter :-</h2>
          <img src="gibralter.jfif" class="img-2" alt="">
          <p>This military operation was pre-planned by Gen.Akhtar. After the success
            in Rann of kutch, Ayub khan(Cheif Martial Law Administrator) agreed
            and the mission was launched in August 1965. According to the mission,
            Pak Army and Guirella force(Mujahideen), dressed in local kashmiri clothes,
            were to be moved in Jammu Kashmir. The strategy of this operation was to create
            mass uprising among Kashmiris and then to officialy attack India. However,
            it failed because these forces were detected by the local Kashmiris and was
            arrested by the Indian Army.

      <h2>Operation Grand Slam :-</h2>
      <p>
        Operation Grandslam is also known as twin of "operation Gibralter" because
        it was too be launched after Gibralter had completed. However, Gibralter was failed
        and Indian forces were alarmed, it was not supposed to launch a military operation under such
        conditions.<img src="grandslam.png" class="img-2 " alt="war 1965">
        The objective of this step was to capture Akhnoor(shown in white circle), and to
        cut Indian supplies through rest of India. Gen.Akhtar launched this operation on 1 September,1965.
        Pak army crossed the cease-fire line, invading futher areas and moving towards Akhnoor. But on 2 Sep,1965
        Gen.Akhtar was replaced with Gen.Yahya. This step proved to be the turning point of Operating Grandslamm.
        because
        India got much time to take their positions in Akhnoor.Yahya Khan ordered thier forces to acquire a defend
        position. Now, a lot of time was wasted and Pak Army failed invade Akhnoor(shown in white circle)
        In this way, Grandslamm was failed. Later on 6 Sep,1965 Indian army crossed the international border of Pakistan
        in Lahore.

      <h2>Beginning of War</h2>
      <p>On the dawn of Sep 6, India, without formal declaration
        of war, crossed the international border and attacked Pakistan from
        Lahore and Kasur fronts. This was the material beginning of war 1965.
        The BRB canal became the battlefeild in this dispute. Indian forces had to cross

        The BRB canal before they attack Lahore city. In this warfare, Majore General
        Aziz Bhatti emerged as a rising star for Pakistan. He disrupted the hostile forces
        for several days and finally was embraced with martyrdom. He was granted with Pakistan's
        highest military award, Nishan-e-Haider.
        Pak force also demoralized Indian forces in many other fronts
        including Kasur, Sialkor, Rhajastan and Sulemanki.
        <!-- With the grace of Allah Almighty and astonishing efforts of 
        Pak tigers, another hostile Indian attack was failed and she was forced to 
        retreat. -->
      <h3>Air war :-</h3>
      <p>
        During the aerial war, PAF tigers inflicted serious injuries to enemy by hitting 
        their targets with pin-point accuracy and taking the control of battlefield.
        On September 1, 1965, the aerial phase of the war began. In four waves, 28 fighter jets were scrambled from Pathankot by the Indian military.
        In response, the Pakistan Air Force sent two F-86 Sabres, flown by Sarfaraz Rafique and Imtiaz Bhatti. Though outnumbered at 2:28 they entered the airspace and engaged with
        Indian aeroplanes. In this battle, four Indian Vampire jets were destroyed while two
        Sabres of Pak safely returned.
        A remarkable contribution of Pak Air Commodore, Muhammad Mahmood Alam, who was flying an F-86 Sabre and shot down five Indian jets in under a minute. He was awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat twice, the nation's third highest military award for his actions.
        The intensity of air war lessened after Sep 8. Both forces changed their doctrine from aerial war to ground attacks and concentrated their efforts on cutting sensitive supply lines

      </p>
      <h3>Tank Battle :-</h3>
      <p>
        Tank War of 1965 can't be left undiscussed due
        to its sky-scraping importance. This was the biggest
        tank war after Battle of Kusrk in WW-2. This war 
        was fought near Chavinda, the Chavinda-Sialkot people wrote a 
        golden history of bravery by sacrificing their lifes
        for the motherland.
       It is said that local people of 
        Pak laid down under the invading tanks with bombs
        and blew themselves, also destroying hundred of 
        Indian tanks. The Chavinda sector seemed out to 
        be the graveyard of Indian tanks. Pakistan claimed
        to knock out 120 Indian tanks and lost its 44 tanks.

   
      </p>
      <h3>Cease Fire :-</h3>
      <p>On sep 20 , The United Nations appealed for a ceasefire, India
        immediately accepted it because it was in the state of crumbling. Pakistan
        accepted it on 23 September with several notable dramatics.
        The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
        The Soviet Union also initiated peace negotiations in Uzbekistan
        to prevent both Sout-Asian countries from fighting. Pak President 
        Ayub khan and Indian P.M. Lal Bahadur Shashtri also signed it.
        Physicaly, but not psychologicaly, peace was developed which also
        broke out in 1971.
